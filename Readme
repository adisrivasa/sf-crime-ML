This is a ReadMe file for running the code present alongwith this.

The file "PreProcess.py" will preprocess the data provided on the InClass competition page.
The file "Algorithm.py" consists of the model, predicting values on the test data and creating the pickle file.
The file "final_model.sav" is the pickle file which you need to download via the drive link given in the end of the report.

Steps to run the code:
1. Run the PreProcess file on the train and test data by entering the command -
      ----->python3 PreProcess.py
   The program will clean both the datasets and output two new csv - "train_final.csv" and "test_final.csv".
2. Now run the Algorithm file on the preprocessed datasets by entering the command -
      ----->python3 Algorithm.py
   The program will run for some amount of time and then produce a pickle file and the submission csv.

Only the above two commands need to be run.
